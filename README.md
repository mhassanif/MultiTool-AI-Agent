# MultiTool-AI-Agent
This project implements a task-solving AI agent built with LangChain and an LLM (Ollama). The agent autonomously uses tools like search, Python REPL, and memory to perform multi-step reasoning and solve real-world queries (e.g., summarizing news, estimating costs, generating reports).
